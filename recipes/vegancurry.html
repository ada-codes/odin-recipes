        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prep your veggies!</strong> Dice the onions and peppers.
                Mince the garlic. Peel the ginger then mince it up good.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Saute your veggies!</strong> Grab a large skillet
            and heat your oil in it over medium high heat. Toss in the
            onions and peppers then saute for 5 minutes. Then add the spinach,
            garlic, and ginger, and cook for 2 minutes or until the spinach
            has wilted.
        </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Simmer</strong>. With kindness, pour your tomatoes
                and their juices into the skillet. Mix in your salt and spices.
                Grab your chickpeas, peas, and coconut milk and add them to
                the skillet, too. Cook for 5 minutes until it's bubbly.
