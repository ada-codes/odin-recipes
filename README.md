Introduction

The current project aims to create a simple, bare bones web page which displays a recipe to its privileged viewer. The website will be constructed with HTML and will demonstrate my ability to use the basics of HTML to create a simple site which includes images, absolute and relative links, headings, paragraph division, and text emphasis.

Further, in the process of completing this project, I will demonstrate my understanding of some of the basic of using git and github, such as pushing commits and creaeting proper commit descriptions.
